## Research question

There is an old statue in the courtyard
that weeps, like Niobe, its sorrow in stone.
The griefs of the ages she has made her own.
Her eyes are rain-washed but not hard,
her body is covered in mould, the garden overgrown.

```javascript
console.log("how about a code snippet")
```


Or alternatively `some inline code` for you?
